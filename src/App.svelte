		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			Humanitarian Access is fundamental to humanitarian action. Without
			it, the broader goal of improving humanitarian conditions of people
			in need of assistance and protection would be impossible.
		</p>
		<p>
			ACAPSâ€™ Humanitarian Access Overview provides an analysis on the
			state of humanitarian access globally. The primary objective of our
			analysis is to inform humanitarian decision makers by presenting a
			summary of the access situation in different countries that face
			humanitarian crises, both recent and protracted.
		</p>
		<p>
			To do so we established the ACAPS Humanitarian Access Methodology
			which groups several indicators under three key dimensions :
		</p>
		<div class="col-center">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span class="blue">Pillar 1</span> : Access of people in need
					to humanitarian aid
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="red">Pillar 2</span> : Access of humanitarian actors
					to affected population
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="green">Pillar 3</span> : Security and physical constraints
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>
			This scoring model rates each dimension on a scale of 0-5 which
			allows us to calculate the overall access score of a country, also
			on a scale of 0-5.
		</p>
		<p>
			Keep scrolling on the map below to view some key findings from our
			report and examples of constraints in each dimension.
