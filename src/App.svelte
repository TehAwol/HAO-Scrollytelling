		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			Humanitarian Access is fundamental to humanitarian action. Without
			it, the broader goal of improving humanitarian conditions of people
			in need of assistance and protection would be impossible.
		</p>
		<p>
			ACAPSâ€™ Humanitarian Access Overview provides an analysis on the
			state of humanitarian access globally. The primary objective of our
			analysis is to inform humanitarian decision makers by presenting a
			summary of the access situation in different countries that face
			humanitarian crises, both recent and protracted.
		</p>
		<p>
			To do so we established the ACAPS Humanitarian Access Methodology
			which groups several indicators under three key dimensions :
		</p>
		<div class="col-center">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong
						><span class="blue">Pillar 1</span> - Access of people in
						need to humanitarian aid</strong
					>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong
						><span class="red">Pillar 2</span> - Access of humanitarian
						actors to affected population</strong
					>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong
						><span class="green">Pillar 3</span> - Security and physical
						constraints</strong
					>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>
			This scoring model rates each dimension on a scale of 0-5 which
			allows us to calculate the overall access score of a country, also
			on a scale of 0-5.

		<h2>Methodology</h2>
		<p>
			Our main objective is to assess the level of access for
			international humanitarian organisations using a holistic approach
			that divides humanitarian access into three core dimensions:
		</p>
		<div class="col-center">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong
						><span class="blue">Pillar 1</span> - Access of people in
						need to humanitarian aid</strong
					>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong
						><span class="red">Pillar 2</span> - Access of humanitarian
						actors to affected population</strong
					>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong
						><span class="green">Pillar 3</span> - Security and physical
						constraints</strong
					>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>
			These dimensions are all scored on a scale of 1 to 5 (as shown on
			the map) and their rounded average form the overall access score for
			a country. Each dimension is composed of several indicators which
			allows us to calculate its score according to thresholds.
		</p>
		<img src="./img/methodology.png" alt="methodology chart" />
		<p>
			Indicators are given a score between 0 (no impact on access) to 3
			(blocking access). They are assessed using different methods,
			including checklists and a mixed approach combining quantitative and
			qualitative information. Sub-indicators with an assigned weight
			reflecting the impact of access for a given indicator help calculate
			its final score.
		</p>
		<h2>Sources</h2>
		<p>
			Our Access Methodology uses a range of qualitative information
			sources combined with relevant datasets in a structured way in order
			to quantify the level of humanitarian access. This data is collected
			by ACAPS analysts from a range of credible and publicly available
			sources, including UN agencies, governments, international and local
			NGOs, international and local media, and humanitarians working in
			the countries and areas analysed.
		</p>

				>Methodology Note</a
			>.
		</p>
		<h3>Limitations</h3>
		<p>
			ACAPSâ€™ Humanitarian Access Overview faces the same limitations as
			all secondary data reviews. Information might not be available
			without physical presence in the countries analysed, and information
			by third parties might come with a certain degree of delay,
			especially in very volatile contexts. When possible, analysts
			cross-check available information with humanitarians working in
			countries of operation.
